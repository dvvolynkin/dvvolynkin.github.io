My friends made\nrapid progress in terms of muscle mass and strength, while I hardly achieved any results and went to\nthe gym less and less often.</p>\n<h2>Starting the fight, counting calories</h2>\n<p>Being a very stubborn person and also a technician, I quickly found out that exercise means nothing.\nThe only thing that really matters is the second law of thermodynamics, which states that calories\nare extracted from the body when the effort is greater than the return.</p>\n<p>The ingenious solution that came to me in my sleep was to go on a diet. I decided that I could “dry\nout” faster if I started counting the calories of everything I ate. And I gave up very quickly. I\nlasted about a month and a half. Counting took so much of my time and brain power that I started to\nmake my diet very predictable. So much so that it successfully included buckwheat, chicken, cottage\ncheese, eggs and oatmeal in the morning. The idea of a varied diet was something of a fad for me.\nLet the future me worry about that, now I have to lose weight.</p>\n<h2>It didn’t work the first time</h2>\n<p>Eventually, the session came and I could no longer be bothered with counting calories, caffeine and\nsugar became my best friends. Lack of sleep, heaps of anxiety, and complete lack of time led me to\nreach for unhealthy food as quickly and confidently as it then stayed with me.</p>\n<p>There was more than one such iteration. I became terribly nervous when my calorie counts failed when\nI did not start cooking when I forgot to weigh an item while cooking. And it started robbing me of a\nbunch of concentration that I had to spend somewhere.</p>\n<p>In the end, I came to simpler options - simple\ndiets. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet\">Keto</a> and no-carb diets (where you cut out all carbs and eat\nonly protein and fats) were very effective in the short term. But as time went on, I got sad and\njust started gaining weight again. Each time it got worse.</p>\n<h2>Losing weight as a project</h2>\n<p>When I found a full-time job, I started doing things differently: I learned the basics of management\nand systems thinking and started building a feedback loop. I measured my weight every day by\nstanding on the scale as a basic habit.</p>\n<p>When you are constantly focused on your goal, you think more about how to optimize your weight\nmetrics. It really worked, I could spend half the day thinking about what I could do to lose weight.\nFor example, replace breakfast by taking casein, a complex protein that takes a long time to digest,\nwhich makes you feel full for a long time, making you less likely to eat something high in calories.</p>\n<p>And I really did lose weight, did not I?</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/aed19341a077514fef90fd8c67e24903/7f7f8/img_1.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 51.89873417721519%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"img 1\"\n        title=\"img 1\"\n        src=\"/static/aed19341a077514fef90fd8c67e24903/828fb/img_1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/aed19341a077514fef90fd8c67e24903/ff44c/img_1.jpg 158w,\n/static/aed19341a077514fef90fd8c67e24903/a6688/img_1.jpg 315w,\n/static/aed19341a077514fef90fd8c67e24903/828fb/img_1.jpg 630w,\n/static/aed19341a077514fef90fd8c67e24903/0ede0/img_1.jpg 945w,\n/static/aed19341a077514fef90fd8c67e24903/3ac88/img_1.jpg 1260w,\n/static/aed19341a077514fef90fd8c67e24903/7f7f8/img_1.jpg 1885w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Then I decided to build healthy habits, like exercising every day. I used behavioral psychology and\nfound <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levor.liferpgtasks&#x26;hl=en_US&#x26;gl=US\">an app</a>\nthat allowed me to build a reward system that motivated me to exercise. I got coins for every\nexercise I did, and when I had enough, I bought myself a luxury item that I would not have just\nbought myself. So I bought a robot vacuum cleaner so I could reflash it and make it drive cursing\nwhen it hit obstacles. Well, and if he would clean, that would not be bad either.</p>\n<h2>Controlling weight and habits as a system</h2>\n<p>As a true data programmer, I have also set up a data acquisition system, storage, connected data\nacquisition from MI -tape, an electronic scale, and a continuous sugar control system.</p>\n<p>The culmination of my control addiction was that I set up two monitors in a room connected to a\nRaspberry Pi, a smart socket that turned them on according to a schedule, Grafana on whose graphs I\ndisplayed all the indicators: weight, average sugar level, number of gold coins, physical activity\ngraphs. There were also large panels that turned red when I was not weighing myself. When I reached\nmy daily goal, I would get a green dashboard and an increase in coins. But it got crazier and\ncrazier.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/886f4925e46690490b8cd65fffc90d10/999ef/img_2.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75.31645569620254%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAQb/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgP/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAcfGtnoiczf/xAAaEAEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDEiEj/9oACAEBAAEFArPcXGjsNFgJMN/P/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAS/9oACAEDAQE/AdjP/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBL/2gAIAQIBAT8Bk//EABkQAAEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAAQIhMf/aAAgBAQAGPwI6qk4//8QAGhABAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIUFRcf/aAAgBAQABPyHg5GupyoNgJTU8LE8HxmWzWf/aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQCN//xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAh/9oACAEDAQE/EAlHmGl3/8QAFxEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARQf/aAAgBAgEBPxB4STG//8QAGxABAAMBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBUXH/2gAIAQEAAT8QuADQ6+9l8UBUdvIv0gE8xil41FOQHcL1d+xxbEVb7P/Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"img 2\"\n        title=\"img 2\"\n        src=\"/static/886f4925e46690490b8cd65fffc90d10/828fb/img_2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/886f4925e46690490b8cd65fffc90d10/ff44c/img_2.jpg 158w,\n/static/886f4925e46690490b8cd65fffc90d10/a6688/img_2.jpg 315w,\n/static/886f4925e46690490b8cd65fffc90d10/828fb/img_2.jpg 630w,\n/static/886f4925e46690490b8cd65fffc90d10/0ede0/img_2.jpg 945w,\n/static/886f4925e46690490b8cd65fffc90d10/3ac88/img_2.jpg 1260w,\n/static/886f4925e46690490b8cd65fffc90d10/999ef/img_2.jpg 2008w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>Here we go again</h2>\n<p>I enjoyed it all very much and it worked well until I went away for three weeks. At first, the habit\nof watching everything I did on the monitor began to destroy my motivation. I just lost the feedback\nloop that kept my system going. It turned out that there was no floor scale where I was going, and\nmy mother and family, who had not seen me in a while, completely ignored my strict eating rules. For\nthree weeks, everything went wrong. I simply could not do the exercises I needed because the\nequipment, like the dumbbells I had bought at home, was not there.</p>\n<p>And when I came back, everything was different. I noticed that the weight had increased, the pennies\nwere getting worse, the motivation had decreased a bit.Suddenly I discovered the disadvantages of\nconstantly having a metric monitor in my life and weighing myself every day. I brainwashed myself\nand started reducing my success and individuality to two metrics: weight and ability to adhere to a\nsystem. The pennies that led me to the rewards I was not particularly keen on became more\nsignificant than what it was actually about.</p>\n<p>The more vacations I had, trips to see family with work from home, days when I was sick, the less\nthis system motivated me.</p>\n<p>In the end, I gave up.</p>\n<p>The weight started to increase. Just when I got sick with Covid, I was in bed for a month and a\nhalf. Six months later I marked +20 kg.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/47486123b7783162cea5e3f6ea8e3e93/56d85/img_3.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 89.24050632911393%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"img 3\"\n        title=\"img 3\"\n        src=\"/static/47486123b7783162cea5e3f6ea8e3e93/828fb/img_3.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/47486123b7783162cea5e3f6ea8e3e93/ff44c/img_3.jpg 158w,\n/static/47486123b7783162cea5e3f6ea8e3e93/a6688/img_3.jpg 315w,\n/static/47486123b7783162cea5e3f6ea8e3e93/828fb/img_3.jpg 630w,\n/static/47486123b7783162cea5e3f6ea8e3e93/0ede0/img_3.jpg 945w,\n/static/47486123b7783162cea5e3f6ea8e3e93/56d85/img_3.jpg 946w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>Addressing systemic issues</h2>\n<p>I picked up a psychologist and started talking about the hyper-control that had gotten me into this\nsituation. After thinking about it, I realized that constantly focusing on my weight and reaching\nfor it was really breaking me. In this mindset, if you do not weigh as much as you “should”, you are\na failure. And when you think that way about yourself, people around you start doing the same\nbecause your self-esteem flies into the abyss.</p>\n<p>I have come to realize that you can not look at weight. Anything other than such a poorly controlled\nmetric. Because then the amplitude of the fluctuation of self-esteem would be as large as the\nextremes of the weight range.</p>\n<p>I decided to focus on habits that would make the weight go down, but I did not put it on a pedestal.</p>\n<p>I knew that just starting to do something would not work for me for long. Measure calories, please,\nbut only until the first meal that breaks it all down. Lifting dumbbells every day for my biceps -\nuntil I went on vacation for a few weeks.</p>\n<h2>Consistency is more important than speed and ambition</h2>\n<p>But after a while it became clear to me. Then I saw it already in individual books\nlike ”<a href=\"https://www.litres.ru/dzheyms-klir/atomnye-privychki-kak-priobresti-horoshie-privychki-i-izbavit/\">Atomic habits</a>”\nor ”<a href=\"https://www.litres.ru/stiven-gayz/mini-privychki-maxi-rezultaty-22637504/\">MINI habits - MAXI results</a>”\n, which confirmed my thoughts. The most important value in supporting systems is consistency. Not\ncompleteness, not ambition, but consistency.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/f1d472ba135443bb3d807b03340cab47/45487/img_4.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 70.25316455696203%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"img 4\"\n        title=\"img 4\"\n        src=\"/static/f1d472ba135443bb3d807b03340cab47/f058b/img_4.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/f1d472ba135443bb3d807b03340cab47/c26ae/img_4.png 158w,\n/static/f1d472ba135443bb3d807b03340cab47/6bdcf/img_4.png 315w,\n/static/f1d472ba135443bb3d807b03340cab47/f058b/img_4.png 630w,\n/static/f1d472ba135443bb3d807b03340cab47/40601/img_4.png 945w,\n/static/f1d472ba135443bb3d807b03340cab47/78612/img_4.png 1260w,\n/static/f1d472ba135443bb3d807b03340cab47/45487/img_4.png 1341w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>If you can afford to break the rules of the system, you challenge the legitimacy of its existence.</p>\n<p>It’s like cigarettes: The best way to quit smoking is to just quit and not smoke again under any\npretext. Not just a little bit, not drunk. Just do not smoke. Once you break the new rule, this\nprecedent becomes very costly and increases the likelihood that you will resume the bad habit many\nmore times. Maybe even hundreds of times.</p>\n<h2>How can you build a system to make it work</h2>\n<p>If you describe the rules of the system in such a way that it is possible to follow them at any\ntime, the system will be difficult to break.</p>\n<p>For example, to implement push-ups, you can do one push-up every day. But every day. Over time, once\nyou have internalised it, you can raise the minimum threshold, but you must always make sure that\nyou are consistent.</p>\n<h2>My results</h2>\n<p>For a long time, I had a desire to develop my writing skills. I opened\na <a href=\"https://t.me/dvvolynkin\">Telegram channel</a>, started writing a post every day, and participated\nin the <a href=\"https://contenthero.me/s16#d9f10d80e4264dfeb8acee64cd5654e0\">Content Hero</a> challenge, which\ninvolved writing a post of at least 400 characters every day. This was relatively easy and created a\nfoundation for consistency.</p>\n<p>Then I added push-ups. To my surprise, after a few weeks, I felt the urge to move more, so I went to\nsquash. I still do push-ups every day, a few times a week it’s already a full-fledged workout at\nhome.</p>\n<p>To develop a systematic control of my diet, I started to write down the last meal of the day and\nthen also write down the calorie count. On 4/7 days a week, I write down everything I ate in a day.</p>\n<p>To write long articles, I have been trying to write at least 10 words a day. It’s getting more and\nmore, although the conclusion always needs to be rewritten. But you end up knowing exactly what the\nstructure is and how you are going to write everything.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/90e6f2d796c1a61a6cb53c604e11da4b/47311/img_5.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 53.16455696202532%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"img 5\"\n        title=\"img 5\"\n        src=\"/static/90e6f2d796c1a61a6cb53c604e11da4b/828fb/img_5.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/90e6f2d796c1a61a6cb53c604e11da4b/ff44c/img_5.jpg 158w,\n/static/90e6f2d796c1a61a6cb53c604e11da4b/a6688/img_5.jpg 315w,\n/static/90e6f2d796c1a61a6cb53c604e11da4b/828fb/img_5.jpg 630w,\n/static/90e6f2d796c1a61a6cb53c604e11da4b/0ede0/img_5.jpg 945w,\n/static/90e6f2d796c1a61a6cb53c604e11da4b/47311/img_5.jpg 1080w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>What problems I encountered</h2>\n<p>Well, first of all, it’s very hard not to even play hooky. Sometimes you are just lazy or an\nimportant point is eaten up by something else. But even a few missed days make an incredible\ndifference in the overall difficulty of getting back to regular work. It’s only a fraction of the\ndifficulty now.</p>\n<p>So if you are sitting in the bar and forget to write down calories or write a post in the evening,\nthe legitimacy of your campaign is undermined a bit, making it less important. And if you put\ntogether a combination of such events, it becomes a serious threat.</p>\n<h2>What I learned along the way</h2>\n<p>I have come to realize that consistency is more important than numbers and results. I also realized\nthat it takes a few years to notice real change.</p>\n<p>I realized that the system of rewards for doing habits works, but in the long run it distracts from\nthe original essence of doing. It also does not provide the consistency and consistency needed. If\nonly at first.</p>\n<p>In all this time, I have learned that any kind of pressure on yourself, whether it’s a dashboard in\nthe middle of the room, willpower, or another person, works until the first fluctuation in life. If,\ndue to some circumstance, you do not have enough resources in the prefrontal cortex to make a\nvolitional decision, your established system will break down. And any pressure on yourself will put\none stone on top of another.</p>\n<p>But unlike the previous point, I have learned that if you lower the standards of heroism, you are\nmuch less likely to screw up. And it allows you to build more complex habits based on the habits you\nalready have.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My samurai way of fighting weight","date":"January 26, 2022","description":"A bit geeky, but truly my approach"}},"previous":null,"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"b32e4d53-80f0-57dd-ab3c-fe8f59aca51b","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":null}},
